### Getting started:

This project is not yet deployed, and this repo is solely the back end for TweedleDoo. The front end can be found here: https://github.com/ShujaatAzim/TweedleDoo-Frontend

Once you have pulled down and cloned this repo, do the following:

1) run `bundle install` to install all the gems/dependencies.
2) run `rails db:create`
3) run `rails db:migrate`
4) run `rails db:seed`
5) run `rails s` to spin up the server.

Now go into the front end (after pulling/cloning, and running `npm install` for the dependencies) and run `npm start`!
